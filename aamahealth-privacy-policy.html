    <h1>The AamaHealth Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 23 June 2023</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how AamaHealth ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and manages your information when you use our AamaHealth mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our App is designed to provide a tracking system for pregnancy and baby development. The App itself does not request, collect, or store any personal data entered by the user. All the data displayed in the App are fetched from our backend server database.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>As the App does not collect or store any data from users, there is no user information used by the App for any purpose. The App only serves to display information fetched from the backend server.</p>

    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose your personal information for purposes other than those outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We employ security measures designed to protect the information transmitted through our App. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.</p>

    <h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be notified through an update on the App or via a notice on our website. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: info@aamahealth.com</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our App. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of 23 June 2023.</p>
